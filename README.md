#ANALYZING SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ABOUT CORONA VIRUS



This project was done using :

- Tweepy the twitter API for Python to collect 1 million tweets using the search API
- One AWS t2.micro instance used to run the script continuously in the background for hours in order to get an important quantity of tweets
- Jupyter notebooks and the Bokeh Library (among others) for visual interpretation of the data
